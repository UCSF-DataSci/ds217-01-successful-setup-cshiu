# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
Hello! My name is Cori and i'm a clinical research coordinator in the department of ophthalmology at UCSF (right across the street!). I have previous experience as an ophthalmic photographer and I'm interested in developing new tech and  I'm involved in studies exploring new tech to measure peripheral visual fields in patients with retina and optic nerve disease. You can come try my 90 second screening test sometime!

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
I hope to gain skills in statistical analyses and hope to use Python and other coding languages to generate memorable, meaningful figures and statistical calculations related to my research projects. 

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
I have zero expectations for this course (I have 7 weeks of STATA and R coding experience) but I'm excited to learn what we can do with Python! I'm a little nervous about learning another coding language -- they are all similar, but have different syntax and I hope I don't get them confused.  

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
It's great that the transportation fee of the graduate student programs at UCSF provide the Clipper Bay Pass -- has anyone taken the SF Bay Ferry to the East Bay / Marin? Truly THE BEST (and honestly the most tolerable) way to commute across the bay! https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/
Unrelated, if you haven't read Why We Sleep by Matthew Walker (faculty at UC Berkeley), you should! If you didn't appreciate the absolute importance of sleep on our ability to function, you will.

*Thank you for sharing! Your responses help me get to know you and hopefully make the course better!*
